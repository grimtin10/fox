# ðŸ¦Š Fox~! Aaaaoooouuu!

Fox is a collection of functionalities that make my time working with Rust a little nicer.

## Libs

`log` - A set of logging functions, but pretty! Colored and dimmed, so the reader's eyes are drawn to the most relevant details first and foremost.

`disk` - Quick file system operation abstractions, to avoid repetetiveness in error handling, printing, etc.
